Seperation of concerns: 
- Seperated User table into 3 tables: User, CashBalance, Portfolio 
- User and Portfolio are functionally different and thus should be normalised 
- User's cash balance was seperated from them because row updates are expensive for large rows and therefore 
seperating high frequency updates into a seperate table makes more sense
