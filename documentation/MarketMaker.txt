THE MARKET MAKER: ticker service rework 
Current ticket service fetches market data for specific tickers via an API call to alpha vantage. 
This is not scalable and very easily hits the daily limit of 25 requests. Due to the limited number of 
calls that can be made, the service is mostly reliant on mock DB data which is very hardcoded and also outdated. 

Proposed solution: 
THE MARKET MAKER will be a reworked ticker service that at the start of the day (run on boot up or cron job): 
- makes a series of batch calls for a large number of tickers on their OPENING price. These are loaded in RAM/ HASHMAP. 
- It will then check the DB for previous closing prices of the ticket in the DB. This is the stock app's opening price. 
- Using brownian motion, it will then begin to generate movements towards the price that was determined by today's opening price. 

FOR EXAMPLE:
Chosen ticker: AAPL
closing price : 150 
real world opening price : 160
market maker from here will gradually fluctuate the market towards 160 and ensures it hits the 160 by the end of the day
